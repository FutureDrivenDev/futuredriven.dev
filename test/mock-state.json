    "content": "<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúIf I only had an hour to chop down a tree, <strong>I would spend the first 45 minutes sharpening my axe</strong>.‚Äù ‚Äì Abraham Lincoln.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hell, I don&#39;t have 45 minutes, Abe! What I have are ambitious plans and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CWq6PNFpOsV/\">dogs</a> who require (and deserve!) more attention than I anticipated. That&#39;s why I created the ultimate, most effective, lowest-possible-effort developer setup for myself. These tools save me hours of work and energy every week, and require only a quick setup time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"layer-1-foundations-for-productivity\">Layer 1: Foundations for productivity</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Install Cron, a Really Good calendar</strong> ‚Äî <a href=\"https://cron.app/\">https://cron.app/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>All promises must exist somewhere, or they will fail (<em>verba volant, scripta manent)</em>. I live and die by my calendar: I always write down todos and reserve time in the future to deliver on the promises I make as my day goes by.  Cron is a the place for them to exist and rightfully occupy my time, so I have to be straight with myself.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Install Notion, a second brain in every device</strong> ‚Äî <a href=\"https://notion.so\">https://notion.so</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>I was very late to discover the exponential power of having a centralized place for notes and references and I&#39;ve found out Notion works very well for me. I mostly just have databases (e.g. <em>Reading List, Startups, Meeting Notes, Blog Posts, Hiring</em>). I create structure as I go. It&#39;s easy to write in. I use the web clipper to capture every tab into one of these lists and <strong>I</strong> <strong>close all my tabs üòÆ‚Äçüí®</strong>  plus, you can launch a website on top of it using the likes of <a href=\"https://super.so\">https://super.so</a>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Install 1Password, never have whats-my-password anxiety again</strong> ‚Äî <a href=\"https://1password.com/\">https://1password.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nothing helps me sleep at night like knowing my data, my identity and my money is safe. 1Password is my choice of password manager, but whichever you use, I pray you use one! After you get used to it, you will never dread login screens again. I specially love how it integrates with 2 factor authentication and generates one-time access code for you, all in the app.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Make Workspaces work for you: attention is precious</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Workspaces allow you to focus on one task at a time. I have a main Dell screen in front of me, and a Macbook Pro 16 as a secondary screen, angled at me ‚Äî for Spotify, or logs. I use three perennial workspaces in my main screen: </p>\n<p>1) <strong>Plans &amp; Comms:</strong> Calendar (Cron) + Email (Superhuman) + WhatsApp. (Least amount of time)</p>\n<p>2) <strong>Writing:</strong> Notion + Whatever slide deck I&#39;m currently editing.</p>\n<p>3) <strong>Coding:</strong> Chrome + various VSCode windows.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BONUS: Tab Groups in Safari</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#39;m slowly starting to admire the grouped tabs feature in Safari. Sometimes it does eat tabs, which is absolutely catastrophic if the purpose of your product is to <strong>save</strong> the tabs. When syncing works, however, it&#39;s great to have pre-set tabs I always use for a given project, like open documents and sheets, etc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"layer-2-essential-developer-tools\">Layer 2: Essential developer tools</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Brew, the command line installer ‚Äî <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">https://brew.sh/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Install anything with a command: <code>brew install ...</code> ‚Äî this is the cornerstone of further setup. Here, you can find the usual suspects like Spotify, Discord, Slack (my condolences), etc. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fig + oh-my-zsh + iTerm2, autocomplete all the things ‚Äî <a href=\"https://fig.io/\">https://fig.io/</a> ‚Äî <a href=\"https://ohmyz.sh/\">https://ohmyz.sh/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>brew install iterm2 fig</code> </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I used to be a <code>fish</code> man, but ever since macOS started shipping with <code>zsh</code> by default, I happily switched over, and <a href=\"https://ohmyz.sh/\">Oh-My-Zsh</a> solves everything forever. And Fig... this comes straight from heaven: autocomplete for your terminal. Let that sink in. A beautifully done tool which should have existed a long time ago! </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>VSCode, the current de-facto web standard ‚Äî <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>brew install visual-studio-code</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, the go-to editor these days. What I&#39;ve taken to lately is to quickly <code>^+`` (Ctrl + tilde) to summon a</code>zsh` right in my project&#39;s path. Beats creating multiple iTerm2 tabs and having to find which one belongs to the project I want.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Deno, from scripting to full stack web apps (and nvm for) ‚Äî <a href=\"https://deno.land\">https://deno.land</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>brew install deno nvm</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you&#39;ve worked with me over the last year you already know I&#39;m excited about Deno. So many good design and architectural choices, in such a lovely package. If you have experience with frontend or with NodeJS, you should try Deno now. And, of course, Node is still a necessary evil for tooling, so <code>nvm</code> is a version manager that contains the damage and allows easy toggling of node versions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"layer-3-just-a-touch-of-magic-utilities\">Layer 3: Just a touch of <del>~magic</del>~ utilities</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Clipy ‚Äî <a href=\"https://github.com/Clipy/Clipy\">https://github.com/Clipy/Clipy</a> ‚Äî my all time favorite, a clipboard manager which opens up a menu with your clipboard history with <code>Cmd+Shift+V</code>. No more back and forth copying multiple strings to forms.</li>\n<li>iStats Menus ‚Äî <a href=\"https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/\">https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/</a> ‚Äî gives visibility on why precisely your Core i7 is struggling to death, or who&#39;s eating all your RAM (hint: it&#39;s Chrome). </li>\n<li>Rectangle Pro ‚Äî <a href=\"https://rectangleapp.com/pro\">https://rectangleapp.com/pro</a> ‚Äî is a snapping window manager that let&#39;s you &quot;slide&quot; windows into place. You have to try it to believe it. </li>\n<li>ColorSlurp ‚Äî <a href=\"https://colorslurp.com/\">https://colorslurp.com/</a> ‚Äî literally the best color picker I&#39;ve ever used.</li>\n<li>Raycast ‚Äî <a href=\"https://www.raycast.com/\">https://www.raycast.com/</a> ‚Äî a supercharged Spotlight. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#39;s how I setup my environment for productivity right now. Thanks for reading, and I hope you found something that works for yourself in the above. If you think there&#39;s another tip that should be in this list, please email me at <a href=\"mailto:gui@futuredriven.dev\">gui@futuredriven.dev</a>.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Gui</p>\n"
